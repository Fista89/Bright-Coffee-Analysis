# Bright-Coffee-Analysis
Analysis of transactional data, from previous months, for the new CEO to better understand the position of the company


Welcome to the Bright Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project! 
The purpose of the analysis is to assist the newly appointed CEO in making strategic decisions to increase revenue and enhance business performance using historical transactional data. By providing key analysis on areas where the business struggles and areas where the business is thriving we can then understand how to fully maximise our strengths while also improving our weaknesses
