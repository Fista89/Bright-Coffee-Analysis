Determine the time of day the store performs best.
Discover sales trends across products and time intervals.
Provide strategic recommendations to improve sales performance.

Calculate total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty
Use SQL for grouping & aggregation
Task 3: Data Analysis & Visualization

Recommendations üí°
Based on these insights, I propose the following recommendations to improve sales performance and operational efficiency:
1.	Optimize the Product Mix: Given the dominance of Coffee and Tea, consider stocking more of the best-selling products within these categories, such as Earl Grey Rg and Dark chocolate Lg, to meet high demand.
2.	Strategic Marketing: Implement marketing campaigns during slow time slots, such as the midday period (12:00 PM to 3:00 PM), to attract customers and boost sales during these lulls. Promotions, happy hour specials, or loyalty program incentives could be effective.
3.	Promote Underperforming Products: Identify products with low sales volumes (e.g., Branded merchandise and Packaged Chocolate) and develop targeted promotions or new product placements to increase their visibility and appeal.
